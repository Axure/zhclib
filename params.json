{"name":"ZhCLib","tagline":"A C library intended for generic and handy usage.","body":"## Get Started\r\n\r\nThis is a C library providing useful method calls that standard C does not provide in handy. \r\n\r\nThis library is implemented in an Object Oriented way, that basic types and string (char *) are primitives, and others are subclasses of Objects, while some grouped utility method calls are named after the rule of member methods.\r\n\r\nFor users who only want to do things in the pure C way, you may still find the string part handy in your development.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under [GNU General Public License Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), and is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n@DreamingInCodeZH\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a problem or come up with some new ideas while utilizing this project, a detailed issue is welcomed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
